## Summary
We decided to incorporate machine learning into predicting the NBA's 2019 winner. This is due to the fact that the data we found on Kaggle only contained data points from 2014-2018. Besides the date range, we had an extensive amount of predictors to choose from: field goals, rebounds, assists and many more. Given the amount of data that we had we decided to use a logical regression model to train and test our data. Unfortunately our model did not have a high accuracy rate. So this brings us to our next question. What other predictors or models should we use or not use to make a more accurate model?
